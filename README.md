### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miha, I am a physicist turned research software engineer. Feel encouraged to reach out in arbitrary digital ways. Some things we could talk about are:
- the Julia language
- who is going to win Wimbledon this year
- [preferred] the cool thing you are working on 
- some of the things I've done in the past, which include Higgs physics at the ATLAS experiment, and optimising electricity grids.

You can also ping me to review your PR in the following repositories (shamelessly copying the README from my ex-coworker [Frames](https://github.com/oxinabox/oxinabox)):
